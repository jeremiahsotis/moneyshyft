# Step 1: Preflight & Context Loading

## STEP GOAL

Verify prerequisites and load all required inputs before generating failing tests.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES

- 📖 Read the entire step file before acting
- ✅ Speak in `{communication_language}`
- 🚫 Halt if requirements are missing

---

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Follow the MANDATORY SEQUENCE exactly
- 💾 Record outputs before proceeding
- 📖 Load the next step only when instructed

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: config, loaded artifacts, and knowledge fragments
- Focus: this step's goal only
- Limits: do not execute future steps
- Dependencies: prior steps' outputs (if any)

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise.

## 1. Prerequisites (Hard Requirements)

- Story approved with **clear acceptance criteria**
- Test framework configured (`playwright.config.ts` or `cypress.config.ts`)
- Development environment available

If any are missing: **HALT** and notify the user.

---

## 1.5 Mandatory Git Policy Gate (Hard Requirement + Auto-Remediation)

Before any ATDD generation work:

- Resolve `{story_file}` first (or ask user explicitly)
- Run `npm run policy:check`
- Run `npm run branch:ensure-workflow -- --workflow _bmad/tea/workflows/testarch/atdd/workflow.yaml --story {story_file}`

Rules:

- If `{story_file}` is not resolved yet, resolve it first (or ask user explicitly).
- If `policy:check` fails **only** because current branch is a protected default branch (`main`, `master`, `codex/dev`, `production`), auto-remediate:
  - Parse `story_id` from `{story_file}` filename prefix (e.g., `0-4-...` -> `0-4`)
  - Derive branch slug from the story filename (kebab case)
  - Run `npm run start:story-branch -- {story_id} {derived_slug}`
  - If that fails due dirty working tree, retry with `npm run start:story-branch -- --allow-dirty {story_id} {derived_slug}`
  - Re-run `npm run policy:check`
- If auto-remediation fails at any point, **HALT** and report the exact failing command.
- Always run `branch:ensure-workflow` after policy check passes.
- If `branch:ensure-workflow` fails, **HALT** and report the failure.
- Do **not** proceed to Step 2 until both commands pass.

---

## 2. Load Story Context

- Read story markdown from `{story_file}` (or ask user if not provided)
- Extract acceptance criteria and constraints
- Identify affected components and integrations

---

## 3. Load Framework & Existing Patterns

- Read framework config
- Inspect `{test_dir}` for existing test patterns, fixtures, helpers

## 3.5 Read TEA Config Flags

From `{config_source}`:

- `tea_use_playwright_utils`
- `tea_browser_automation`

---

## 4. Load Knowledge Base Fragments

Use `{knowledgeIndex}` to load:

**Core (always):**

- `data-factories.md`
- `component-tdd.md`
- `test-quality.md`
- `test-healing-patterns.md`
- `selector-resilience.md`
- `timing-debugging.md`

**Playwright Utils (if enabled):**

- `overview.md`, `api-request.md`, `network-recorder.md`, `auth-session.md`, `intercept-network-call.md`, `recurse.md`, `log.md`, `file-utils.md`, `network-error-monitor.md`, `fixtures-composition.md`

**Playwright CLI (if tea_browser_automation is "cli" or "auto"):**

- `playwright-cli.md`

**MCP Patterns (if tea_browser_automation is "mcp" or "auto"):**

- (existing MCP-related fragments, if any are added in future)

**Traditional Patterns (if utils disabled):**

- `fixture-architecture.md`
- `network-first.md`

---

## 5. Confirm Inputs

Summarize loaded inputs and confirm with the user. Then proceed.

---

## 6. Save Progress

**Save this step's accumulated work to `{outputFile}`.**

- **If `{outputFile}` does not exist** (first save), create it with YAML frontmatter:

  ```yaml
  ---
  stepsCompleted: ['step-01-preflight-and-context']
  lastStep: 'step-01-preflight-and-context'
  lastSaved: '{date}'
  ---
  ```

  Then write this step's output below the frontmatter.

- **If `{outputFile}` already exists**, update:
  - Add `'step-01-preflight-and-context'` to `stepsCompleted` array (only if not already present)
  - Set `lastStep: 'step-01-preflight-and-context'`
  - Set `lastSaved: '{date}'`
  - Append this step's output to the appropriate section.

Load next step: `{nextStepFile}`

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS:

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Step completed in full with required outputs

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Skipped sequence steps or missing outputs
  **Master Rule:** Skipping steps is FORBIDDEN.
