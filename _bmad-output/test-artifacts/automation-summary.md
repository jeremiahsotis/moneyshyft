  - `network-first.md`
  - `selector-resilience.md`
  - `api-testing-patterns.md`
  - `playwright-cli.md`

## Step 2 - Identify Automation Targets

### Browser Exploration
- Attempted `playwright-cli` exploration for selector validation.
- Result: CLI browser bootstrap failed in environment (`listen EINVAL` on Playwright CLI socket).
- Fallback applied: code and artifact-driven selector/flow analysis.

### Acceptance Criteria to Test Targets
- AC1: Shared envelope helpers for success/refusal/system error serialization.
- AC2: Business refusals must remain `HTTP 200` with `ok=false`.

### Selected Test Levels
- **API** (primary): enforce envelope contract semantics and payload shape.
- **E2E** (secondary): journey-level contract confidence through story fixture composition.

### Priority Assignment
- P0:
  - success envelope contract
  - business refusal transport semantics
- P1:
  - system error envelope no-stack hardening
  - top-level key consistency and correlation stability

### Coverage Plan
- API target file:
  - `tests/api/platform/1-4-shared-response-envelope-and-refusal-helpers.api.spec.ts`
- E2E target file:
  - `tests/e2e/platform/1-4-shared-response-envelope-and-refusal-helpers.spec.ts`
- Scope: `critical-paths`

## Step 3C - Aggregate Test Generation Results

### Parallel Subprocess Execution
- API subprocess output:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-api-tests-2026-02-20T11-05-01-3NZ.json`
- E2E subprocess output:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-e2e-tests-2026-02-20T11-05-01-3NZ.json`
- Verification:
  - `success: true` for both subprocess outputs
  - output files present and valid JSON

### Files Written to Disk
- `tests/api/platform/1-4-shared-response-envelope-and-refusal-helpers.api.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/platform/1-4-shared-response-envelope-and-refusal-helpers.spec.ts`

### Fixture/Helper Aggregation
- Reused existing fixture/helper assets:
  - `apiClient`
  - `sharedResponseEnvelopeStory14Factory`
  - `sharedResponseEnvelopeStory14Fixture`
- No new fixture infrastructure required for this story slice.

### Summary Metrics
- Total tests generated: `7`
  - API tests: `4` (1 file)
  - E2E tests: `3` (1 file)
- Priority coverage:
  - P0: `2`
  - P1: `5`
  - P2: `0`
  - P3: `0`
- Summary artifact:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-summary-2026-02-20T11-05-01-3NZ.json`

## Step 4 - Validate and Summarize

### Validation Results
- Framework readiness: passed.
- Coverage mapping by AC and priority: passed.
- Test quality checks on generated files:
  - No hard waits (`waitForTimeout`) detected.
  - No conditional visibility branching anti-patterns detected.
- CLI session cleanup:
  - no open session persisted (exploration did not establish a live session).

### Key Assumptions
- Story 1.4 contract endpoints remain:
  - `/api/v1/platform/_kernel/contracts/envelope/response-matrix/success`
  - `/api/v1/platform/_kernel/contracts/envelope/response-matrix/business-refusal`
  - `/api/v1/platform/_kernel/contracts/envelope/response-matrix/system-error`
- Existing Story 1.4 fixture/factory contracts are source of truth for expected payload and response semantics.

### Risks
- Tests were generated from code/artifact analysis without live browser snapshot confirmation due CLI runtime issue.
- Endpoint behavior is assumed stable against story fixture expectations; if route contracts drift, tests will fail as designed.

### Recommended Next Workflow
- `[RV] Review Tests` for quality gate scoring and maintainability checks.
- `[TR] Trace Requirements` to map Story 1.4 ACs to generated automated tests.

- Test dependencies detected in `/Users/jeremiahotis/moneyshyft/package.json`:
  - `@playwright/test`
  - `playwright`
- Result: Framework readiness check passed.

  - `fixtures-composition.md`
- Browser automation reference:
  - `playwright-cli.md`

## Story 1.5 Run - Step 2: Identify Automation Targets

### Browser Exploration
- `playwright-cli` is installed in the environment.
- Workflow target is script/CI guard enforcement (no browser surface required), so selector snapshotting was skipped.
- Fallback applied by design: artifact/code analysis only.

### Acceptance Criteria to Test Targets
- AC1: Policy checks execute as first blocking gate and prevent downstream CI quality jobs on failure.
- AC2: Branch guard command enforces story/epic workflow branch compliance with actionable diagnostics.

### Selected Test Levels
- **API** (primary): CI workflow graph and script-level policy/guard command semantics.
- **E2E** (secondary): maintainer journey across local policy + branch-guard command flow outcomes.

### Priority Assignment
- P0:
  - Policy-first dependency chain enforcement in CI graph
  - Local default-branch policy rejection diagnostics
  - Story workflow branch mismatch rejection diagnostics
- P1:
  - Epic workflow branch mismatch diagnostics
  - Missing parameter diagnostics (`--story`, epic numeric validation)
  - Maintainer journey validation for pass/fail combinations

### Coverage Plan
- API target file:
  - `tests/api/platform/1-5-policy-gate-and-branch-workflow-guard-enforcement.api.spec.ts`
- E2E target file:
  - `tests/e2e/platform/1-5-policy-gate-and-branch-workflow-guard-enforcement.spec.ts`
- Scope: `critical-paths`
- ATDD duplication control:
  - Existing `.atdd.*` files preserved as RED-phase references
  - Generated executable coverage in non-ATDD spec files for CI regression use

## Story 1.5 Run - Step 3C: Aggregate Test Generation Results

### Parallel Subprocess Execution
- API subprocess output:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-api-tests-2026-02-20T13-12-59-759Z.json`
- E2E subprocess output:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-e2e-tests-2026-02-20T13-12-59-759Z.json`
- Verification:
  - `success: true` for both subprocess outputs
  - output files present and valid JSON

### Files Written to Disk
- `tests/api/platform/1-5-policy-gate-and-branch-workflow-guard-enforcement.api.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/platform/1-5-policy-gate-and-branch-workflow-guard-enforcement.spec.ts`

### Fixture/Helper Aggregation
- Reused existing fixture/helper assets:
  - `story15Context`
  - `policyScriptTestHarness`
  - `branchWorkflowGuardTestHarness`
- No new fixture infrastructure required for this story slice.

### Summary Metrics
- Total tests generated: `9`
  - API tests: `6` (1 file)
  - E2E tests: `3` (1 file)
- Priority coverage:
  - P0: `3`
  - P1: `6`
  - P2: `0`
  - P3: `0`
- Summary artifact:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-summary-2026-02-20T13-12-59-759Z.json`

## Story 1.5 Run - Step 4: Validate and Summarize

### Validation Results
- Framework readiness: passed.
- Coverage mapping by AC and priority: passed.
- Test quality checks on generated files:
  - No hard waits (`waitForTimeout`) detected.
  - Deterministic script-harness assertions and explicit diagnostics checks.
- CLI session cleanup:
  - no browser session started for this run.
- Temp artifacts:
  - subprocess outputs and summary persisted under `/tmp/tea-automate-*.json`.

### Execution Verification
- Command run:
  - `npx playwright test tests/api/platform/1-5-policy-gate-and-branch-workflow-guard-enforcement.api.spec.ts tests/e2e/platform/1-5-policy-gate-and-branch-workflow-guard-enforcement.spec.ts`
- Result:
  - `9 passed`
  - runtime `865ms`

### Key Assumptions
- CI pipeline canonical file remains `.github/workflows/test.yml`.
- Guard and policy command contract remains:
  - `scripts/enforce-git-policy.sh`
  - `scripts/branch-ensure-workflow.sh`
- Existing Story 1.5 fixture and harness utilities remain source-of-truth for branch/workflow policy contract expectations.

### Risks
- Browser selector verification was intentionally skipped because story scope is script/CI policy enforcement.
- If guard command output wording changes, regex-based diagnostics assertions will fail and should be updated intentionally.

### Recommended Next Workflow
- `[RV] Review Tests` for quality scoring and maintainability checks.
- `[TR] Trace Requirements` to map Story 1.5 ACs to generated automated tests and gate readiness evidence.

## Story 1.6 Run - Step 1: Preflight and Context

### Framework Verification
- Framework detected: `playwright.config.ts` exists at repository root.
- Test dependencies detected in `/Users/jeremiahotis/moneyshyft/package.json`:

  - `fixtures-composition.md`
- Additional pattern references:
  - `api-testing-patterns.md`
  - `network-first.md`
  - `playwright-cli.md`

### Browser Exploration Status
- Attempted Playwright CLI browser exploration for `/platform/security-verification`.
- Result: blocked by sandbox permission (`EPERM` creating Playwright daemon session cache).
- Fallback applied: code and artifact-driven target discovery.

## Story 1.6 Run - Step 2: Identify Automation Targets

### Browser Exploration
- Attempted `playwright-cli` exploration in `auto` mode.
- Result: local sandbox prevented session creation (`EPERM` on Playwright daemon cache path).
- Fallback applied: repository code + artifacts + fixture-driven selector/flow analysis.

### Acceptance Criteria to Test Targets
- AC1 (tenant isolation + CSRF on state-changing routes):
  - cross-tenant read/write guard enforcement
  - spoofed active-tenant/active-org-unit header rejection
  - CSRF required/invalid/valid proof paths
  - cookie policy matrix assertions for app/api sibling domains
- AC2 (secret redaction in logs/event payloads):
  - redaction verification contract expectations
  - plaintext marker absence assertions in returned payloads

### ATDD Duplication Control
- Existing RED-phase ATDD files retained:
  - `tests/api/platform/1-6-security-controls-and-redaction-verification.atdd.api.spec.ts`
  - `tests/e2e/platform/1-6-security-controls-and-redaction-verification.atdd.spec.ts`
- Automation scope expands beyond ATDD by adding:
  - deterministic positive/negative API coverage without `test.skip`
  - header-spoof edge checks (`x-active-tenant-id`, `x-active-org-unit-id`)
  - cookie environment matrix coverage depth
  - explicit `P0/P1` executable suite structure for CI lanes

### Selected Test Levels
- **API** (primary): enforce security contract semantics and rejection behavior deterministically.
- **E2E** (secondary): operator security-verification journey and evidence-surface checks.

### Priority Assignment
- P0:
  - cross-tenant read/write rejection invariants
  - CSRF missing proof rejection
- P1:
  - spoofed active context rejection invariants
  - valid CSRF acceptance + cookie posture matrix checks
  - redaction verification contract assertions and plaintext absence checks

### Coverage Plan
- API target file:
  - `tests/api/platform/1-6-security-controls-and-redaction-verification.api.spec.ts`
- E2E target file:
  - `tests/e2e/platform/1-6-security-controls-and-redaction-verification.spec.ts`

  - `tests/support/factories/securityControlsStory16Factory.ts`
  - `tests/support/helpers/apiClient.ts`
  - `tests/support/factories/csrfCookiePolicyFactory.ts`

## Story 1.6 Run - Step 4: Validate and Summarize

### Validation Results
- Framework readiness: passed.
- Coverage mapping by AC and priority: passed.
- Generated file structure: passed.
  - `tests/api/platform/1-6-security-controls-and-redaction-verification.api.spec.ts`
  - `tests/e2e/platform/1-6-security-controls-and-redaction-verification.spec.ts`
- Test quality checks on generated files:
  - no hard waits (`waitForTimeout`) detected.
  - no conditional visibility flow anti-pattern (`if (await ...isVisible())`) detected.
  - no `try/catch` flow-control anti-pattern detected.
- CLI session cleanup:
  - explicit `playwright-cli -s=tea-automate close` issued after exploration attempt.

### Execution Verification
- Command run:
  - `npx playwright test tests/api/platform/1-6-security-controls-and-redaction-verification.api.spec.ts tests/e2e/platform/1-6-security-controls-and-redaction-verification.spec.ts --list`
- Result:
  - `12` tests discovered across 2 files
  - syntax/discovery passed

### Artifact Persistence
- Runtime subprocess artifacts:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-api-tests-2026-02-20T14-13-41-006Z.json`
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-e2e-tests-2026-02-20T14-13-41-006Z.json`
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-summary-2026-02-20T14-13-41-006Z.json`
- Persisted copy under test artifacts:

  - `_bmad-output/test-artifacts/automation-temp/tea-automate-e2e-tests-2026-02-20T14-13-41-006Z.json`
  - `_bmad-output/test-artifacts/automation-temp/tea-automate-summary-2026-02-20T14-13-41-006Z.json`

### Key Assumptions
- Story 1.6 security contract endpoints are expected to remain:
  - `/api/v1/platform/_kernel/tenancy/repository-check`
  - `/api/v1/platform/_kernel/security/csrf/guard`
  - `/api/v1/platform/_kernel/security/cookies/policy/evaluate`
- Redaction verification endpoint contract target remains:
  - `/api/v1/platform/_kernel/security/redaction/verify`

### Risks
- Browser exploration was blocked by sandbox permissions (`EPERM` for Playwright daemon session cache), so selector validation used code/artifact fallback.
- Redaction verification route is represented as `test.fixme` until endpoint behavior is implemented and stabilized.

### Recommended Next Workflow
- `[RV] Review Tests` to score maintainability and quality gates for generated Story 1.6 coverage.
- `[TR] Trace Requirements` to map Story 1.6 acceptance criteria to generated executable automation and gate evidence.

## Story a.1 Run - Step 2: Identify Automation Targets

### Target Determination
- Acceptance criteria mapped to automation targets:
  - AC1: module-level fail-closed behavior across API and operator UI surfaces.
  - AC2: selective sub-flag capability exposure with explicit refusal/unavailable messaging.
- Existing ATDD RED tests retained as non-duplicative baseline; automation expansion targeted executable non-ATDD coverage.

### Selected Test Levels
- **API** (primary): refusal envelope behavior and capability gating contracts.
- **E2E** (secondary): operator-visible unavailable/capability states and disabled actions.

### Priority Assignment
- P0:
  - Module-off fail-closed behavior on critical entry actions.
- P1:
  - Capability-level selective exposure and deterministic refusal/messaging behavior.

### Coverage Plan
- API output file:
  - `tests/api/platform/a-1-connectshyft-feature-flag-and-availability-guardrails.api.spec.ts`
- E2E output file:
  - `tests/e2e/platform/a-1-connectshyft-feature-flag-and-availability-guardrails.spec.ts`
- Support infrastructure files:
  - `tests/support/factories/connectShyftStoryA1Factory.ts`
  - `tests/support/fixtures/connectShyftStoryA1.fixture.ts`

## Story a.1 Run - Step 3: Parallel Test Generation Orchestration

### Subprocess Launch and Completion
- API subprocess output:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-api-tests-2026-02-22T08-33-12-620Z.json`
- E2E subprocess output:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-e2e-tests-2026-02-22T08-33-12-620Z.json`
- Verification:
  - both subprocess outputs exist and parse as valid JSON.

### Performance Report
- Execution mode: `PARALLEL (API + E2E)`
- API generation and E2E generation completed concurrently in one orchestration pass.
- Sequential equivalent would require separate generation passes; parallel mode preserved the expected ~50% workflow-time gain.

## Story a.1 Run - Step 3C: Aggregate Test Generation Results

### Files Written to Disk
- `tests/api/platform/a-1-connectshyft-feature-flag-and-availability-guardrails.api.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/platform/a-1-connectshyft-feature-flag-and-availability-guardrails.spec.ts`
- `tests/support/factories/connectShyftStoryA1Factory.ts`
- `tests/support/fixtures/connectShyftStoryA1.fixture.ts`

### Fixture Aggregation
- Aggregated fixture needs from subprocess outputs:
  - `connectShyftStoryA1Factory`
  - `connectShyftStoryA1Fixture`

### Summary Metrics
- Total tests generated: `10`
  - API tests: `6` (1 file)
  - E2E tests: `4` (1 file)
- Priority coverage:
  - P0: `3`
  - P1: `7`
  - P2: `0`
  - P3: `0`
- Aggregated summary artifact:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-summary-2026-02-22T08-33-12-620Z.json`

## Story a.1 Run - Step 4: Validate and Summarize

### Validation Results
- Framework readiness: passed.
- Coverage mapping by AC and priority: passed.
- File generation structure: passed.
- Test quality checks on generated files:
  - no hard waits (`waitForTimeout`) detected.
  - no conditional visibility flow anti-pattern (`if (await ...isVisible())`) detected.
  - no `try/catch` flow-control anti-pattern in test bodies detected.
- Playwright discovery check:
  - `npx playwright test ... --list` reported `10` tests in `2` files.
- CLI session hygiene:
  - confirmed no open `tea-automate` session remains.
- Temp artifact location requirement:
  - Runtime outputs generated in `/tmp` and persisted under:
    - `/Users/jeremiahotis/projects/connectshyft/_bmad-output/test-artifacts/automation-temp/tea-automate-api-tests-2026-02-22T08-33-12-620Z.json`
    - `/Users/jeremiahotis/projects/connectshyft/_bmad-output/test-artifacts/automation-temp/tea-automate-e2e-tests-2026-02-22T08-33-12-620Z.json`
    - `/Users/jeremiahotis/projects/connectshyft/_bmad-output/test-artifacts/automation-temp/tea-automate-summary-2026-02-22T08-33-12-620Z.json`

### Key Assumptions
- Story a.1 endpoint contracts and refusal codes align with planning artifacts and existing ATDD baseline:
  - `CONNECTSHYFT_MODULE_DISABLED`
  - `CONNECTSHYFT_ESCALATION_CAPABILITY_DISABLED`
  - `CONNECTSHYFT_WEBHOOKS_DISABLED`
- UI selectors in generated E2E tests match the planned ConnectShyft availability UX contract.

### Risks
- ConnectShyft frontend route surfaces are not yet present in the current app router (`/app/connectshyft/inbox` unresolved in live exploration), so E2E tests are currently forward-looking and expected to remain red until implementation lands.
- No ConnectShyft backend module files are currently present in `src/`, so API tests are also implementation-driving for this story stage.

### Recommended Next Workflow
- `[RV] Review Tests` for maintainability and quality scoring.
- `[TR] Trace Requirements` to map story a.1 AC coverage to generated automation artifacts.

## Story a.2 Run - Step 1: Preflight and Context

### Framework Verification
- Framework detected: `playwright.config.ts` exists at repository root.
- Test dependencies detected in `/Users/jeremiahotis/projects/connectshyft/package.json`:
  - `@playwright/test`
  - `playwright`
- Result: Framework readiness check passed.

### Execution Mode
- Mode selected: **BMad-Integrated**.
- Basis:
  - Story artifact loaded: `/Users/jeremiahotis/projects/connectshyft/_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/a-2-tenant-and-orgunit-context-enforcement-for-connectshyft-routes.md`

  - `network-first.md`
  - `selector-resilience.md`
  - `api-testing-patterns.md`

## Story a.2 Run - Step 2: Identify Automation Targets

### Browser Exploration
- `playwright-cli` detected and available in the environment.
- Live application endpoints were not reachable during run (`http://127.0.0.1:5174` and `http://127.0.0.1:3000/health` returned connection failure), so browser snapshot exploration was skipped.
- Fallback applied: code/artifact-driven selector and flow analysis.

### Acceptance Criteria to Test Targets
- AC1: Resolve and validate tenant/orgUnit context for ConnectShyft orgUnit-scoped routes, with tenant-privileged bypass behavior.
- AC2: Refuse missing/invalid/cross-tenant orgUnit contexts without leaking protected data.

### Selected Test Levels
- **API** (primary): context resolution and refusal semantics, including no-leak behavior.
- **E2E** (secondary): operator-facing refusal UX and tenant-privileged override visibility.

### Priority Assignment
- P0:
  - missing orgUnit context refusal
  - invalid orgUnit context refusal
  - cross-tenant orgUnit mismatch refusal
- P1:
  - non-member rejection in valid tenant context
  - spoofed orgUnit/header rejection behavior
  - tenant-admin bypass semantics and operator copy contracts

### Coverage Plan
- API target file:
  - `tests/api/platform/a-2-tenant-and-orgunit-context-enforcement-for-connectshyft-routes.api.spec.ts`
- E2E target file:
  - `tests/e2e/platform/a-2-tenant-and-orgunit-context-enforcement-for-connectshyft-routes.spec.ts`
- Supporting fixture/factory targets:
  - `tests/support/factories/connectShyftStoryA2Factory.ts`
  - `tests/support/fixtures/connectShyftStoryA2.fixture.ts`
- Scope: `critical-paths`
- ATDD duplication control:
  - Existing `.atdd.*` files retained as RED-phase baseline.
  - Generated non-ATDD automation specs provide expanded post-ATDD regression coverage.

## Story a.2 Run - Step 3C: Aggregate Test Generation Results

### Parallel Subprocess Execution
- API subprocess output:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-api-tests-2026-02-22T09-51-47-951Z.json`
- E2E subprocess output:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-e2e-tests-2026-02-22T09-51-47-951Z.json`
- Verification:
  - `success: true` for both subprocess outputs
  - output files present and valid JSON

### Files Written to Disk
- `tests/api/platform/a-2-tenant-and-orgunit-context-enforcement-for-connectshyft-routes.api.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/platform/a-2-tenant-and-orgunit-context-enforcement-for-connectshyft-routes.spec.ts`
- `tests/support/factories/connectShyftStoryA2Factory.ts`
- `tests/support/fixtures/connectShyftStoryA2.fixture.ts`

### Fixture/Helper Aggregation
- Added Story a.2 fixture/factory infrastructure:
  - `connectShyftStoryA2Factory`
  - `connectShyftStoryA2Fixture`
- Reused shared support helpers:
  - `apiRequest`
  - `createTenantScopeHeaders`

### Summary Metrics
- Total tests generated: `13`
  - API tests: `8` (1 file)
  - E2E tests: `5` (1 file)
- Priority coverage:
  - P0: `5`
  - P1: `8`
  - P2: `0`
  - P3: `0`
- Summary artifact:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-summary-2026-02-22T09-51-47-951Z.json`
- Persisted temp artifacts:
  - `_bmad-output/test-artifacts/automation-temp/tea-automate-api-tests-2026-02-22T09-51-47-951Z.json`
  - `_bmad-output/test-artifacts/automation-temp/tea-automate-e2e-tests-2026-02-22T09-51-47-951Z.json`
  - `_bmad-output/test-artifacts/automation-temp/tea-automate-summary-2026-02-22T09-51-47-951Z.json`

## Story a.2 Run - Step 4: Validate and Summarize

### Validation Results
- Framework readiness: passed.
- Coverage mapping by AC and priority: passed.
- Generated spec parse validation:
  - `npx playwright test --list tests/api/platform/a-2-tenant-and-orgunit-context-enforcement-for-connectshyft-routes.api.spec.ts tests/e2e/platform/a-2-tenant-and-orgunit-context-enforcement-for-connectshyft-routes.spec.ts`
  - Result: passed (13 tests discovered).
- CLI session cleanup:
  - no TEA browser session was created (exploration skipped due unavailable local app targets).
- Temp artifact placement:
  - artifacts persisted under `_bmad-output/test-artifacts/automation-temp`.

### Key Assumptions
- Story a.2 is still marked `ready-for-dev` and implementation is not complete in current backend/frontend route stack.
- To avoid breaking default CI while preserving coverage intent, generated Story a.2 tests are encoded as `test.fixme` scenarios.

### Risks
- Until Story a.2 implementation lands, these tests act as executable intent and regression placeholders, not active pass/fail validation.
- Browser snapshot verification was not performed against a running local application instance.

### Recommended Next Workflow
- `[RV] Review Tests` for quality scoring and maintainability checks.
- `[TR] Trace Requirements` to map Story a.2 ACs to ATDD + automate coverage and confirm gate readiness.

## Story a.3 Run - Step 1: Preflight and Context

### Framework Verification
- Framework detected: `playwright.config.ts` exists at repository root.
- Test dependencies detected in `package.json`:
  - `@playwright/test`
  - `playwright`
- Result: Framework readiness check passed.

### Execution Mode
- Mode selected: **BMad-Integrated**.
- Basis:
  - Story artifact loaded: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/a-3-orgunit-number-mapping-management.md`
  - Existing ATDD files found for Story a.3:

  - `fixture-architecture.md`
  - `network-first.md`
  - `selector-resilience.md`

## Story a.3 Run - Step 2: Identify Automation Targets

### Browser Exploration
- `playwright-cli` was available and executed in session `tea-automate`.
- Target URL probed:
  - `http://127.0.0.1:5174/app/connectshyft/settings/numbers?...`
- Findings from CLI run:
  - Vue Router warning: no route match for `/app/connectshyft/settings/numbers`.
  - API auth bootstrap returned `401` on `/api/v1/auth/me`.
  - Snapshot artifact was empty in this environment.
- Result: selector discovery fell back to code/story artifact analysis.

### Acceptance Criteria to Target Mapping
- AC1 (`FR-CS-025`): multi-number create/update behavior with deterministic read-back.
- AC2 (`FR-CS-026`): tenant-safe duplicate number rejection with actionable validation details.

### Selected Test Levels
- **API** (primary): contract behavior for save/update/duplicate/validation/tenant-boundary refusals.
- **E2E** (secondary): operator-path validation for number mapping UI form/table behavior and actionable refusal feedback.

### Priority Assignment
- P0:
  - multi-number save/read-back determinism
  - duplicate tenant-number refusal semantics
- P1:
  - invalid E.164 refusal details
  - cross-tenant orgUnit write refusal
  - update-path state preservation and UI consistency

### Coverage Plan
- API target file:
  - `tests/api/platform/a-3-orgunit-number-mapping-management.api.spec.ts`
- E2E target file:
  - `tests/e2e/platform/a-3-orgunit-number-mapping-management.spec.ts`
- Scope: `critical-paths`
- ATDD duplication handling:
  - Existing `.atdd.*` files remain RED references.
  - New non-ATDD specs provide automation expansion coverage for story progression.

## Story a.3 Run - Step 3C: Aggregate Test Generation Results

### Parallel Subprocess Outputs
- API subprocess output:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-api-tests-2026-02-22T12-01-06-456Z.json`
- E2E subprocess output:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-e2e-tests-2026-02-22T12-01-06-456Z.json`
- Summary output:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-summary-2026-02-22T12-01-06-456Z.json`
- Verification:
  - Both subprocess payloads marked `success: true`.
  - All output files were written and JSON-valid.

### Files Written to Disk
- `tests/api/platform/a-3-orgunit-number-mapping-management.api.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/platform/a-3-orgunit-number-mapping-management.spec.ts`

### Automation Temp Artifact Mirror
- `_bmad-output/test-artifacts/automation-temp/tea-automate-api-tests-2026-02-22T12-01-06-456Z.json`

- `_bmad-output/test-artifacts/automation-temp/tea-automate-summary-2026-02-22T12-01-06-456Z.json`

### Summary Metrics
- Total tests generated: `9`
  - API tests: `5` (1 file)
  - E2E tests: `4` (1 file)
- Priority coverage:
  - P0: `4`
  - P1: `5`
  - P2: `0`
  - P3: `0`
- Fixture needs:
  - `connectShyftStoryA3Factory`
  - `connectShyftStoryA3Fixture`
- Subprocess execution mode:
  - `PARALLEL (API + E2E)`
  - Estimated performance gain: `~50% faster than sequential`

## Story a.3 Run - Step 4: Validate and Summarize

### Validation Results
- Framework readiness: passed.
- Coverage mapping by AC and priority: passed.
- Generated specs are recognized by Playwright test discovery:
  - `npx playwright test --list tests/api/platform/a-3-orgunit-number-mapping-management.api.spec.ts tests/e2e/platform/a-3-orgunit-number-mapping-management.spec.ts`
- Quality checks on generated files:
  - No hard waits (`waitForTimeout`) used.
  - No conditional visibility anti-patterns introduced.
  - Priority tags (`@P0`, `@P1`) present for selective execution.
- CLI session hygiene:
  - `playwright-cli -s=tea-automate close` executed; no orphan session left.

### Key Assumptions
- Number-mapping endpoints and UI route remain target-state contracts under active implementation.
- Refusal code semantics follow shared envelope conventions already used in Story a.2 and ATDD artifacts.

### Risks
- Since `/app/connectshyft/settings/numbers` is not currently routed and auth bootstrap returned `401`, E2E selectors are contract-targeted and not runtime-verified in this environment.
- API routes for number mappings are not yet present in `src/src/routes/api/v1/connectshyft.ts`; generated tests are intentionally marked `test.fixme` until implementation is complete.

### Recommended Next Workflow
- `[RV] Review Tests` to run TEA quality audit on generated Story a.3 automation specs.
- `[TR] Trace Requirements` to map Story a.3 ACs and FRs (`FR-CS-025`, `FR-CS-026`) to ATDD + automate coverage.

## Story a.4 Run - Step 1: Preflight and Context

### Framework Verification
- Framework detected: `playwright.config.ts` exists at repository root.
- Test dependencies detected in `package.json`:
  - `@playwright/test`
  - `playwright`
- Result: Framework readiness check passed.

### Execution Mode

    - `tests/e2e/platform/a-4-escalation-baseline-and-recipient-configuration.atdd.spec.ts`

### Context Loaded
- Story and planning artifacts loaded:

  - `tests/support/fixtures/connectShyftStoryA4.fixture.ts`

### TEA Config Flags
- `tea_use_playwright_utils: true`
- `tea_browser_automation: auto`

### Knowledge Fragments Loaded
- Core:
  - `test-levels-framework.md`
  - `test-priorities-matrix.md`
  - `data-factories.md`
  - `selective-testing.md`
  - `ci-burn-in.md`

  - `playwright-cli.md`

### Input Confirmation
- Step 1 inputs are complete for Story a.4.
- Proceeding to target identification and test generation planning.

## Story a.4 Run - Step 2: Identify Automation Targets

### Browser Exploration
- `playwright-cli` available (`1.59.0-alpha-1771104257000`) and executed using session `tea-automate`.
- Target URL probed:
  - `http://127.0.0.1:5174/app/connectshyft/settings/escalation?flags=module:on,inbox:on,escalation:on,webhooks:on&tenantId=tenant-connectshyft-alpha&orgUnitId=org-connectshyft-alpha-east&tenantRole=ORGUNIT_ADMIN`
- Findings:
  - Vue Router warning: no route match for `/app/connectshyft/settings/escalation`.
  - Auth bootstrap request `/api/v1/auth/me` returned `401`.
  - Snapshot artifacts were empty in this environment.
- Session hygiene:
  - `playwright-cli -s=tea-automate close` executed successfully.

### Acceptance Criteria to Target Mapping
- AC1 (persist valid baseline + recipients):
  - successful configuration write with integer-hour baseline (`1-24`)
  - default baseline fallback to `24` when omitted
  - persisted payload echo/readback contract
- AC2 (refuse invalid assignments/timings):
  - out-of-range baseline refusal
  - non-integer baseline refusal
  - missing required recipient refusal
  - invalid cross-tenant/cross-orgUnit recipient refusal
  - refusal responses must be deterministic and envelope-compliant

### ATDD Duplication Control
- Existing RED ATDD files remain baseline intent tests:
  - `tests/api/platform/a-4-escalation-baseline-and-recipient-configuration.atdd.api.spec.ts`
  - `tests/e2e/platform/a-4-escalation-baseline-and-recipient-configuration.atdd.spec.ts`
- Automation expansion will generate non-ATDD executable specs (`.api.spec.ts` / `.spec.ts`) for regression lanes without mutating ATDD files.

### Selected Test Levels
- **API** (primary): escalation config contract and validation semantics.
- **E2E** (secondary): orgUnit admin settings flow, field validation copy, and persistence confirmation behavior.

### Priority Assignment
- P0:
  - valid baseline+recipients persistence
  - default `24` baseline fallback
  - out-of-range / non-integer baseline refusals
  - missing required recipient refusal
- P1:
  - cross-tenant recipient assignment refusal details
  - UI-level deterministic validation messaging and blocked save indicators

### Coverage Plan
- API target file:
  - `tests/api/platform/a-4-escalation-baseline-and-recipient-configuration.api.spec.ts`
- E2E target file:
  - `tests/e2e/platform/a-4-escalation-baseline-and-recipient-configuration.spec.ts`
- Supporting context assets reused:
  - `tests/support/factories/connectShyftStoryA4Factory.ts`
  - `tests/support/fixtures/connectShyftStoryA4.fixture.ts`
- Scope justification:
  - `critical-paths` selected to enforce FR-CS-027 contract-critical behavior while avoiding over-coverage duplication with existing ATDD RED specs.

## Story a.4 Run - Step 3: Parallel Test Generation Orchestration

### Subprocess Launch
- API subprocess output target:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-api-tests-2026-02-22T19-15-56-835Z.json`
- E2E subprocess output target:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-e2e-tests-2026-02-22T19-15-56-835Z.json`
- Execution mode:
  - `PARALLEL (API + E2E)`

### Completion Verification
- API subprocess status: `success: true`
- E2E subprocess status: `success: true`
- Output files present and JSON-valid for both subprocesses.

### Performance Report
- Parallel orchestration completed in a single pass for both test levels.
- Sequential equivalent would require two generation passes.
- Performance gain target met: `~50% faster than sequential`.

### Fixture Infrastructure
- Existing fixture/helper infrastructure reused (no new fixture files required):
  - `storyA4Context`
  - `storyA4AdminHeaders`
  - `storyA4ValidConfigPayload`
  - `storyA4InvalidRangePayload`
  - `apiRequest`

## Story a.4 Run - Step 4: Validate and Summarize

### Validation Results
- Framework readiness: passed.
- Coverage mapping by AC and priority: passed.
- Generated spec parse/discovery validation:
  - `npx playwright test --list tests/api/platform/a-4-escalation-baseline-and-recipient-configuration.api.spec.ts tests/e2e/platform/a-4-escalation-baseline-and-recipient-configuration.spec.ts`
  - Result: passed (`10` tests discovered in `2` files).
- Quality checks on generated files:
  - no hard waits (`waitForTimeout`) detected.
  - no conditional visibility anti-pattern (`if (await ...isVisible())`) detected.
  - no `try/catch` flow-control anti-pattern detected.
- CLI session hygiene:
  - `playwright-cli -s=tea-automate close` confirms no orphaned browser session.

### Artifact Persistence
- Runtime subprocess artifacts:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-api-tests-2026-02-22T19-15-56-835Z.json`
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-e2e-tests-2026-02-22T19-15-56-835Z.json`
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-summary-2026-02-22T19-15-56-835Z.json`
- Persisted under test artifacts:

  - `_bmad-output/test-artifacts/automation-temp/tea-automate-e2e-tests-2026-02-22T19-15-56-835Z.json`
  - `_bmad-output/test-artifacts/automation-temp/tea-automate-summary-2026-02-22T19-15-56-835Z.json`

### Key Assumptions
- Story a.4 contract endpoint remains:
  - `/api/v1/connectshyft/escalation/config`
- Story a.4 operator UI route remains:
  - `/app/connectshyft/settings/escalation`
- Required response/refusal codes remain as defined in Story a.4 ATDD artifacts.

### Risks
- Current repository route file `src/src/routes/api/v1/connectshyft.ts` does not yet expose `/escalation/config`; generated API automation is marked `test.fixme` pending implementation.
- Browser exploration showed no route match for escalation settings UI and a `401` auth bootstrap response; generated E2E automation is marked `test.fixme` until UI/runtime availability is implemented.

### Recommended Next Workflow
- `[RV] Review Tests` for quality scoring and maintainability gate review.
- `[TR] Trace Requirements` to map Story a.4 acceptance criteria to ATDD + automate coverage evidence.

## Story a.5 Run - Step 1: Preflight and Context

### Framework Verification
- Framework detected: `playwright.config.ts` exists at repository root.

## Story a.5 Run - Step 2: Identify Automation Targets

### Browser Exploration
- `playwright-cli` executed in session `tea-automate`.
- Target URLs probed:
  - `http://127.0.0.1:5174/app/connectshyft/settings/numbers?...`
  - `http://127.0.0.1:5174/app/connectshyft/settings/escalation?...`
- Findings:
  - Vue Router warning: no route match for both ConnectShyft settings paths.
  - Auth bootstrap request `/api/v1/auth/me` returned `401`.
  - Snapshot files were generated but empty due unresolved route surface.
- Session hygiene:
  - `playwright-cli -s=tea-automate close` executed successfully.

### Acceptance Criteria to Target Mapping
- AC1: Capability checks enforced server-side at endpoint/service boundaries.
- AC2: Shared envelope semantics validated for success/refusal/system-error paths.

### ATDD Duplication Control
- Existing RED ATDD files retained:
  - `tests/api/platform/a-5-capability-based-route-access-and-envelope-contract-compliance.atdd.api.spec.ts`
  - `tests/e2e/platform/a-5-capability-based-route-access-and-envelope-contract-compliance.atdd.spec.ts`
- Automation expansion generated non-ATDD executable coverage:
  - `tests/api/platform/a-5-capability-based-route-access-and-envelope-contract-compliance.api.spec.ts`
  - `tests/e2e/platform/a-5-capability-based-route-access-and-envelope-contract-compliance.spec.ts`

### Selected Test Levels
- **API** (primary): capability enforcement and envelope contract checks.
- **E2E** (secondary): operator-path refusal guidance and journey-level envelope assertions.

### Priority Assignment
- P0:
  - number-mapping capability refusal for non-authorized roles
  - blocked number-mapping writes with persistence guardrails
  - escalation-config capability refusal with persisted-state preservation
- P1:
  - refusal envelope no-leak behavior on blocked claim attempts
  - success/refusal/system-error top-level envelope key consistency
  - operator-path refusal feedback journeys for missing UI surface readiness

### Coverage Plan
- API target file:
  - `tests/api/platform/a-5-capability-based-route-access-and-envelope-contract-compliance.api.spec.ts`
- E2E target file:
  - `tests/e2e/platform/a-5-capability-based-route-access-and-envelope-contract-compliance.spec.ts`
- Scope: `critical-paths`

## Story a.5 Run - Step 3: Parallel Test Generation Orchestration

### Subprocess Launch
- API subprocess output target:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-api-tests-2026-02-22T20-32-59-618Z.json`
- E2E subprocess output target:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-e2e-tests-2026-02-22T20-32-59-618Z.json`
- Execution mode:
  - `PARALLEL (API + E2E)`

### Completion Verification
- API subprocess status: `success: true`
- E2E subprocess status: `success: true`
- Output files present and JSON-valid for both subprocesses.

### Performance Report
- Parallel orchestration completed in one pass for API and E2E generation.
- Sequential equivalent would require two generation passes.
- Performance gain target met: `~50% faster than sequential`.

## Story a.5 Run - Step 3C: Aggregate Test Generation Results

### Files Written to Disk
- `tests/api/platform/a-5-capability-based-route-access-and-envelope-contract-compliance.api.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/platform/a-5-capability-based-route-access-and-envelope-contract-compliance.spec.ts`

### Fixture Infrastructure
- Reused existing fixture/helper infrastructure:
  - `storyA5Context`
  - `storyA5OrgUnitAdminHeaders`
  - `storyA5OrgUnitMemberHeaders`
  - `storyA5TenantViewerHeaders`
  - `storyA5ValidEscalationPayload`
  - `apiRequest`
  - `login`
- No new shared fixture files required.

### Summary Metrics
- Total tests generated: `8`
  - API tests: `5` (1 file)
  - E2E tests: `3` (1 file)
- Priority coverage:
  - P0: `5`
  - P1: `3`
  - P2: `0`
  - P3: `0`
- Summary artifact:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-summary-2026-02-22T20-32-59-618Z.json`

### Artifact Persistence

## Story a.5 Run - Step 4: Validate and Summarize

### Validation Results
- Framework readiness: passed.
- Coverage mapping by AC and priority: passed.
- Generated spec parse/discovery validation:
  - `npx playwright test --list tests/api/platform/a-5-capability-based-route-access-and-envelope-contract-compliance.api.spec.ts tests/e2e/platform/a-5-capability-based-route-access-and-envelope-contract-compliance.spec.ts`
  - Result: passed (`8` tests discovered in `2` files).
- Quality checks on generated files:
  - no hard waits (`waitForTimeout`) used.
  - no conditional visibility anti-pattern (`if (await ...isVisible())`) introduced.
  - priority tags (`@P0`, `@P1`) present for selective execution.
- CLI sessions cleaned up:
  - no orphaned `tea-automate` browser session.
- Official documentation cross-check completed for recommendation alignment:
  - Playwright Best Practices and Parallelism docs
  - Cypress Test Isolation docs
  - Pact provider verification docs
  - GitHub Actions workflow docs
- Temp artifacts stored in workflow artifact path:
  - `_bmad-output/test-artifacts/automation-temp`.

### Key Assumptions
- Story a.5 ConnectShyft API contracts align with current route implementation in `src/src/routes/api/v1/connectshyft.ts`.
- Shared system-error envelope verification for this run uses the platform contract endpoint:
  - `/api/v1/platform/_kernel/contracts/envelope/response-matrix/system-error`

### Risks
- ConnectShyft settings UI routes are not currently matched by frontend router in this environment; two operator-path tests are marked `test.fixme` pending route availability.
- Full runtime execution against live backend/frontend was not run in this step; validation was parse/discovery-level.

### Recommended Next Workflow
- `[RV] Review Tests` for quality scoring and maintainability checks.
- `[TR] Trace Requirements` to map Story a.5 AC coverage to generated automation and ATDD assets.

- Findings from CLI snapshot/console:
  - Vue Router warning: no route match for `/app/connectshyft/neighbors/new`
  - `GET /api/v1/auth/me` returned `500`
  - HMR websocket connection refused at `127.0.0.1:5174`
- Session hygiene:
  - `playwright-cli -s=tea-automate close` executed successfully.

### Acceptance Criteria to Target Mapping
- AC1: tenant-scoped neighbor create with normalized phone output and shared envelope.
- AC2: deterministic refusal when phone entries are missing.
- AC3: valid phone persistence normalization and envelope consistency.
- Expansion targets:
  - invalid phone format refusal no-leak checks
  - capability refusal on neighbor create mutation
  - cross-tenant/orgUnit refusal no identity leakage

### Selected Test Levels
- **API** (primary): scope enforcement, validation refusals, envelope contracts.
- **E2E** (secondary): operator neighbor-create journey and validation/error states.

### Priority Assignment
- P0:
  - valid tenant-scoped create + normalized phone contract
  - missing-phone refusal contract
  - cross-tenant scope refusal with no data leakage
- P1:
  - invalid-phone refusal contract
  - capability denial on create mutation

- Output files present and JSON-valid for both subprocesses.

### Performance Report
- Parallel orchestration completed in a single pass for both test levels.
- Sequential equivalent would require two generation passes.
- Performance gain target met: `~50% faster than sequential`.

  - `connectShyftStoryB2Factory`
  - `apiRequest`
  - `login`
- No new shared fixture files required.

### Summary Metrics

## Story b.2 Run - Step 4: Validate and Summarize

### Validation Results
- Framework readiness: passed.
- Coverage mapping by AC and priority: passed.
- Generated spec parse/discovery validation:
  - `npx playwright test --list tests/api/platform/b-2-shared-tenant-identity-and-shared-phone-indicators.api.spec.ts tests/e2e/platform/b-2-shared-tenant-identity-and-shared-phone-indicators.spec.ts`
  - Result: passed (`8` tests discovered in `2` files).
- Quality checks on generated files:
  - no hard waits (`waitForTimeout`) used.
  - no conditional visibility anti-pattern (`if (await ...isVisible())`) introduced.
  - priority tags (`@P0`, `@P1`) present for selective execution.
- CLI sessions cleaned up:
  - no orphaned `tea-automate` browser session.
- Temp artifacts stored in workflow artifact path:
  - `_bmad-output/test-artifacts/automation-temp`.

### Key Assumptions
- Story b.2 contract endpoints will be implemented as described in artifact expectations:
  - `PUT /api/v1/connectshyft/neighbors/:neighborId`
  - `GET /api/v1/connectshyft/neighbors/:neighborId`
  - `GET /api/v1/connectshyft/neighbors`
- Story b.2 operator UI route will be implemented for neighbor profile journeys:
  - `/app/connectshyft/neighbors/:neighborId`

### Risks
- Current backend route surface does not expose Story b.2 update/read neighbor endpoints; generated API tests are marked `test.fixme` pending implementation.
- Current frontend router does not expose Story b.2 neighbor profile route; generated E2E tests are marked `test.fixme` pending UI implementation.

### Recommended Next Workflow
- `[RV] Review Tests` for quality scoring and maintainability checks.
- `[TR] Trace Requirements` to map Story b.2 AC coverage to ATDD + automate evidence.

## Story b.3 Run - Step 1: Preflight and Context

### Framework Verification
- Framework detected: `playwright.config.ts` exists at repository root.
- Test dependencies detected in `/Users/jeremiahotis/projects/connectshyft/package.json`:
  - `@playwright/test`
  - `playwright`
- Result: Framework readiness check passed.

### Execution Mode

## Story b.3 Run - Step 2: Identify Automation Targets

### Browser Exploration
- `playwright-cli` session `tea-automate` executed against:
  - `http://127.0.0.1:5174/app/connectshyft/neighbors/neighbor-b3-probe?...`
- Result:
  - `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` during `open`.
  - Snapshot captured only browser error page (`chrome-error://chromewebdata/`), not app DOM.
- Session hygiene:
  - `playwright-cli -s=tea-automate close` executed.

### Acceptance Criteria to Target Mapping
- AC1: relationship-gated authorization allows edit only for active-thread relationship in current orgUnit or tenant-privileged role.
- AC2: successful edit includes `org_unit_id` provenance with actor/mutation context in audit/outbox metadata.
- AC3: unauthorized edit returns deterministic refusal messaging with no sensitive data leakage.

### ATDD Duplication Control
- Existing RED ATDD files retained and unchanged:
  - `tests/api/platform/b-3-relationship-gated-neighbor-edits-with-provenance-audit.atdd.api.spec.ts`
  - `tests/e2e/platform/b-3-relationship-gated-neighbor-edits-with-provenance-audit.atdd.spec.ts`
- Automation expansion generated non-ATDD regression targets:
  - `tests/api/platform/b-3-relationship-gated-neighbor-edits-with-provenance-audit.api.spec.ts`
  - `tests/e2e/platform/b-3-relationship-gated-neighbor-edits-with-provenance-audit.spec.ts`

### Selected Test Levels
- **API** (primary): policy gating, provenance metadata, refusal no-leak guarantees, envelope-key consistency.
- **E2E** (secondary): operator journey-level permission UX, deterministic refusal guidance, tenant-privileged override path.

### Priority Assignment
- P0:
  - related identity lead allow path + provenance assertions
  - tenant-privileged allow path + provenance assertions
  - unrelated actor refusal with no leakage
  - related operator save journey with provenance UI assertions
- P1:
  - refusal-code/message stability across repeated unauthorized attempts
  - envelope key parity across allow/refusal edit paths
  - unrelated and tenant-privileged operator journey hardening

### Coverage Plan
- API target file:
  - `tests/api/platform/b-3-relationship-gated-neighbor-edits-with-provenance-audit.api.spec.ts`
- E2E target file:
  - `tests/e2e/platform/b-3-relationship-gated-neighbor-edits-with-provenance-audit.spec.ts`

- Execution mode:
  - `PARALLEL (API + E2E)`

### Completion Verification
- API subprocess status: `success: true`, `test_count: 5`
- E2E subprocess status: `success: true`, `test_count: 3`
- Both output files present and JSON-valid.

### Performance Report
- Parallel orchestration completed in one pass for both test levels.
- Sequential equivalent would require two independent generation passes.
- Performance gain target met: `~50% faster than sequential`.

- CLI sessions cleaned up:
  - no orphaned `tea-automate` browser session.
- Temp artifacts stored in workflow artifact path:
  - `_bmad-output/test-artifacts/automation-temp`.

### Key Assumptions
- Story b.3 contracts remain aligned with artifact ACs:
  - `PUT /api/v1/connectshyft/neighbors/:neighborId`
  - deterministic refusal envelope behavior for unauthorized callers
  - provenance metadata shape in audit/outbox response data
- Operator UI route exists for permission-gated neighbor profile editing:
  - `/app/connectshyft/neighbors/:neighborId`

### Risks
- Story dependency gate indicates `b.3` depends on `c.3`; unmet dependency may block green execution until prerequisite contract work lands.
- Browser exploration could not reach local app host during this run; selector validation relied on existing ATDD conventions and current UI contracts.

### Recommended Next Workflow
- `[RV] Review Tests` for quality scoring and maintainability checks.
- `[TR] Trace Requirements` to map Story b.3 AC coverage to ATDD + automate evidence.

## Story c.3 Run - Step 2: Identify Automation Targets

### Browser Exploration
- `playwright-cli` executed in session `tea-automate` against:
  - `http://localhost:5174/app/connectshyft/inbox?flags=module:on,inbox:on,escalation:on,webhooks:on&tenantId=tenant-connectshyft-c3&orgUnitId=org-connectshyft-c3-east&tenantRole=ORGUNIT_MEMBER&orgUnitMemberships=org-connectshyft-c3-east`
- Result:
  - redirected to login (`/login?redirect=/app/connectshyft/inbox?...`)
  - app-level C.3 selectors were not available from authenticated inbox/thread surfaces
  - console showed auth/HMR errors (`/api/v1/auth/me` `500`, websocket refused)
- Session hygiene:
  - `playwright-cli -s=tea-automate close` executed successfully.

### Acceptance Criteria to Target Mapping
- AC1: orgUnit-scoped inbox/detail payloads include `lastInboundCsNumberId` and `preferredOutboundCsNumberId`.
- AC2: deterministic ordering by `priorityRank ASC`, `lastActivityAtUtc DESC`, `threadId ASC`.
- AC3: urgency labels map to operator-safe language.
- AC4: claimed voicemail threads remain in Mine with voicemail indicator and no inbox bounce.
- AC5: thread-detail action controls match lifecycle state contracts.

### ATDD Duplication Control

### Selected Test Levels
- **API** (primary): ordering, metadata, action contracts, urgency mapping, and envelope parity.
- **E2E** (secondary): operator journey assertions for inbox/mine/thread-detail behavior and controls.

### Priority Assignment
- P0:
  - deterministic inbox ordering + metadata contract
  - lifecycle action-set contract by thread state
  - operator inbox/mine critical journey assertions
- P1:
  - urgency label mapping no-internal leakage
  - voicemail mine retention contract

### Validation Results
- Framework readiness: passed.

- Quality checks on generated files:
  - no hard waits (`waitForTimeout`) used.
  - no conditional visibility anti-pattern (`if (await ...isVisible())`) introduced.

- CLI sessions cleaned up:
  - no orphaned `tea-automate` browser session.
- Temp artifacts stored in workflow artifact path:

### Key Assumptions
- Story c.3 final contracts will expose deterministic list/detail payloads aligned to artifact AC semantics.
- UI surfaces for Mine and thread-detail will expose C.3-specific data-testid markers used by generated automation.

### Risks
- Current backend route surface does not implement c.3 contract endpoints/codes used by generated API assertions (for example `CONNECTSHYFT_INBOX_LISTED`, `CONNECTSHYFT_THREAD_DETAIL_LOADED`, `CONNECTSHYFT_MINE_LISTED`).
- Current frontend route/component surface does not yet provide Mine/thread-detail C.3 selectors and states.
- Generated c.3 automate specs are intentionally marked `test.fixme` pending c.3 implementation readiness.

### Recommended Next Workflow
- `[RV] Review Tests` for quality scoring and maintainability checks.
- `[TR] Trace Requirements` to map Story c.3 AC coverage to ATDD + automate evidence.

### Acceptance Criteria to Target Mapping
- AC1: canonical lifecycle transition gate coverage for claim/takeover/close policy paths.
- AC2: audit/outbox provenance assertions for successful lifecycle transitions.
- AC3: CLOSED outbound reopen semantics for call/message flows.
- AC4: CLOSED inbound no-auto-reopen behavior for inbound/fallback events.

### Priority Assignment
- P0:
  - claim and takeover canonical contract envelopes for authorized operators.

### Coverage Plan
- API target file:
  - `tests/api/platform/c-4-claim-takeover-and-close-lifecycle-actions.automate.api.spec.ts`
- E2E target file:
  - `tests/e2e/platform/c-4-claim-takeover-and-close-lifecycle-actions.automate.spec.ts`
- Scope: `critical-paths`

## Story c.4 Run - Step 3: Parallel Test Generation Orchestration

### Subprocess Launch
- Timestamp:
  - `2026-02-25T13-10-14Z`
- API subprocess output target:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-api-tests-2026-02-25T13-10-14Z.json`
- E2E subprocess output target:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-e2e-tests-2026-02-25T13-10-14Z.json`
- Execution mode:
  - `PARALLEL (API + E2E)`

### Completion Verification
- API subprocess status: `success: true`, `test_count: 7`
- E2E subprocess status: `success: true`, `test_count: 7`
- Both output files present and JSON-valid.

### Performance Report
- Parallel orchestration completed in one pass for both test levels.
- Sequential equivalent would require two independent generation passes.
- Performance gain target met: `~50% faster than sequential`.

## Story c.4 Run - Step 3C: Aggregate Test Generation Results

### Files Written to Disk
- `tests/api/platform/c-4-claim-takeover-and-close-lifecycle-actions.automate.api.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/platform/c-4-claim-takeover-and-close-lifecycle-actions.automate.spec.ts`

### Fixture Infrastructure
- Reused existing fixture/helper infrastructure:
  - `connectShyftStoryC4.fixture`
  - `connectShyftStoryC4Factory`
  - `apiRequest`
  - `login`
- No new shared fixture files required.

### Summary Metrics
- Total tests generated: `14`
  - API tests: `7` (1 file)
  - E2E tests: `7` (1 file)
- Priority coverage:
  - P0: `4`
  - P1: `8`
  - P2: `2`
  - P3: `0`
- Summary artifact:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-summary-2026-02-25T13-10-14Z.json`

### Artifact Persistence
- Runtime subprocess artifacts:
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-api-tests-2026-02-25T13-10-14Z.json`
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-e2e-tests-2026-02-25T13-10-14Z.json`
  - `/tmp/tea-automate-summary-2026-02-25T13-10-14Z.json`
- Persisted under test artifacts:
  - `/Users/jeremiahotis/projects/connectshyft/_bmad-output/test-artifacts/automation-temp/tea-automate-api-tests-2026-02-25T13-10-14Z.json`
  - `/Users/jeremiahotis/projects/connectshyft/_bmad-output/test-artifacts/automation-temp/tea-automate-e2e-tests-2026-02-25T13-10-14Z.json`

## Story c.4 Run - Step 4: Validate and Summarize

### Validation Results
- Framework readiness: passed.
- Coverage mapping by AC and priority: passed.
- Generated spec parse/discovery validation:
  - `npx playwright test --list tests/api/platform/c-4-claim-takeover-and-close-lifecycle-actions.automate.api.spec.ts tests/e2e/platform/c-4-claim-takeover-and-close-lifecycle-actions.automate.spec.ts`
  - Result: passed (`14` tests discovered in `2` files).
- Quality checks on generated files:
  - no hard waits (`waitForTimeout`) detected.
  - no conditional visibility anti-pattern (`if (await ...isVisible())`) detected.
  - no `try/catch` flow-control anti-pattern introduced.
  - priority tags (`@P0`, `@P1`, `@P2`) present for selective execution.
- CLI sessions cleaned up:
  - no orphaned `tea-automate` browser session.
- Temp artifacts stored in workflow artifact path:
  - `_bmad-output/test-artifacts/automation-temp`.

### Key Assumptions
- Story c.4 contract endpoints will be implemented/extended to align with artifact expectations:
  - `POST /api/v1/connectshyft/threads/:threadId/close`
  - `POST /api/v1/connectshyft/threads/:threadId/call`
  - `POST /api/v1/connectshyft/threads/:threadId/messages`
  - `POST /api/v1/connectshyft/webhooks/inbound`
- Existing claim/takeover routes continue returning deterministic envelopes while lifecycle persistence evolves.

### Risks
- Browser exploration could not reach local app host during this run (`ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`), so selector validation relied on existing story artifacts and current fixture conventions.
- Close/reopen endpoint surface is not fully present in current route implementation; generated c.4 automate tests remain `test.skip` until c.4 implementation lands.

### Recommended Next Workflow
- `[RV] Review Tests` for quality scoring and maintainability checks.
- `[TR] Trace Requirements` to map Story c.4 AC coverage to ATDD + automate evidence.

- `tea_browser_automation: auto`

### Knowledge Fragments Loaded
- Core:
  - `test-levels-framework.md`
  - `test-priorities-matrix.md`
  - `data-factories.md`
  - `selective-testing.md`
  - `ci-burn-in.md`

  - `network-first.md`
  - `selector-resilience.md`

## Story ux-r1 Run - Step 2: Identify Automation Targets

### Browser Exploration
- `playwright-cli` executed in session `tea-automate` against:
  - `http://127.0.0.1:5174/app/connectshyft/inbox?...`
- Result:
  - browser launched successfully
  - page load failed with `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` (local app host unavailable)
  - snapshot step could not proceed due no reachable page/session socket conflict after failed open
- Session hygiene:
  - `playwright-cli -s=tea-automate close` confirmed no lingering open session.

### Acceptance Criteria to Target Mapping
- AC1: persistent bottom-nav contract (`Inbox`, `Mine`, `More`) with no hidden fourth primary tab.
- AC2: Inbox/Mine large-card readability and tap-target thresholds (`>=16px` body text, `>=44px` primary targets).
- AC3: thread-detail state-action contract parity by lifecycle state.
- AC4: responsive discoverability contract (neighbor/conference context, voicemail visibility, no hidden policy path).

### ATDD Duplication Control
- Existing RED ATDD files retained and unchanged:
  - `tests/api/platform/ux-r1-mobile-first-inbox-mine-thread-redesign.atdd.api.spec.ts`
  - `tests/e2e/platform/ux-r1-mobile-first-inbox-mine-thread-redesign.atdd.spec.ts`
- Automation expansion generated non-ATDD regression targets:
  - `tests/api/platform/ux-r1-mobile-first-inbox-mine-thread-redesign.api.spec.ts`
  - `tests/e2e/platform/ux-r1-mobile-first-inbox-mine-thread-redesign.spec.ts`

### Selected Test Levels
- **API** (primary): contract verification for nav/card/readability/action-matrix/responsive metadata.
- **E2E** (secondary): operator journeys for mobile-first nav/readability/discoverability behavior.

### Priority Assignment
- P0:
  - bottom-nav primary-surface contract
  - large-card readability/tap-target contract
  - state-action matrix parity
- P1:
  - responsive discoverability metadata and voicemail/context visibility
  - envelope key parity hardening

### Coverage Plan
- API target file:
  - `tests/api/platform/ux-r1-mobile-first-inbox-mine-thread-redesign.api.spec.ts`
- E2E target file:
  - `tests/e2e/platform/ux-r1-mobile-first-inbox-mine-thread-redesign.spec.ts`
- Scope: `critical-paths`
- Implementation readiness finding:
  - story status is `ready-for-dev`; ux-r1 selectors/contract fields are not fully implemented yet.
  - generated automate tests are intentionally `test.fixme`-gated until ux-r1 implementation lands.

- Temp artifacts storage:
  - subprocess and summary JSON artifacts persisted under `_bmad-output/test-artifacts/automation-temp`.

### Coverage Summary
- API coverage file:
  - `tests/api/platform/ux-r1-mobile-first-inbox-mine-thread-redesign.api.spec.ts`
  - `5` tests (`P0: 3`, `P1: 2`)
- E2E coverage file:
  - `tests/e2e/platform/ux-r1-mobile-first-inbox-mine-thread-redesign.spec.ts`
  - `4` tests (`P0: 3`, `P1: 1`)
- Total generated tests: `9`

### Key Assumptions
- ux-r1 contract extensions will be implemented as specified in the story and locked UX artifacts:
  - bottom-nav test-id contract for `Inbox`, `Mine`, `More`
  - card readability/tap-target metadata contracts
  - thread header context discoverability selectors
  - responsive discoverability and hidden-policy-path guards

### Risks
- Local browser exploration could not connect to app host (`ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`), so selector verification relied on story artifacts and source analysis.
- Current UX story status is `ready-for-dev`; generated automate tests are intentionally `test.fixme`-gated until implementation lands.

### Recommended Next Workflow
- `[RV] Review Tests` for quality scoring and maintainability checks.
- `[TR] Trace Requirements` to map Story ux-r1 AC coverage to ATDD + automate evidence.
